My name is Keegan Skeate, the creator of Cannlytics. Cannlytics was born in the tumultuous Winter of 2020 to help people access cannabis data. A group of dedicated scientists, developers, researchers, and professionals gathered over the following years in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cannabis-data-science/" class="background-hover">Cannabis Data Science Meetup</a> each week working to advance the scientific knowledge of cannabis data and analytics. The mission is to help people access cannabis data, from cultivation, to processing, to the lab, to retail, to the consumer and beyond to analysis. From the time a measurement is made, Cannlytics helps make the data available. Hopefully, the ability for everyone interested to access cannabis data provides value and benefit to many people around the world.

## Open Source

We hope that you find Cannlytics valuable. If you benefit from the open-source code or data, then please consider [contributing](https://opencollective.com/cannlytics-company) to help us to continue providing value for you.
