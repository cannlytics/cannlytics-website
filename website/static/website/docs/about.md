## About

Cannlytics mission is to collect, standardize, and publish cannabis data and statistics to help advance the scientific knowledge of cannabis. All of our code and data is open source and available to the public. We believe that everyone in the cannabis industry should be able to access extensive, valuable data quickly and easily and that you will be better off for it.


<!-- FIXME: Re-write call for donations:

<!-- FIXME: Re-write: -->
In the Winter of 2020, an economist turned software developer, Keegan Skeate, undertook the crafting of the Cannlytics platform to help make cannabis testing simple, easy, and accessible. Since then, the team has grown and Cannlytics is now a hearty community of developers and scientists dedicated to sharing their knowledge to create value, help people, and advance cannabis science.

I would like to help people access lab data easier in the lab, for the lab's clients, for the retailers of the clients, and for the end consumers. My mission is help connect people to their laboratory data. From the time data is generated from a scientific instrument, there is a long pipeline to get the data to the end consumer. In a nutshell, the data is often transcribed by a lab analyst, entered into an Excel spreadsheet, funneled into a database, looked at by multiple people, put on a certificate, then emailed or delivered through a portal to the client. The client, a wholesaler, then has to relay the certificate to their retailers. By this point, the chain is so convoluted that consumers can not quickly review actual lab results. So, there is interesting and potentially valuable lab data at different bottlenecks, but poor system communication often renders it useless. I would like to help everyone access cannabis data easier, from people in the lab to producers to retailers to consumers, researchers, and everyone interested.
