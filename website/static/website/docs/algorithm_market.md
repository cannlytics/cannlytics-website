## A Cannabis Algorithm Market

Welcome to <span class="text-gradient text-gradient-reverse fw-bold">*The Algorithm Farm*</span>, a place where you can create and publish useful algorithms for people in the cannabis space to use at the price of your choice. The steps of creating an algorithm entail:

1. You publish your algorithm, specifying what data it can use.
2. Your consumers buy or supply data and pay for a computation job by your algorithm.
3. Your consumer monitors the logs and receives the algorithm output.

The algorithms that you create on <span class="text-gradient text-gradient-reverse fw-bold">*The Algorithm Farm*</span> are assets that **belong to you** and are composed of:

- The algorithm's code.
- A Docker image to run your algorithm.<svg data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-html="true" title="There are several pre-built Docker images that you can use." class="mb-1 ms-1 text-dark" fill="none" height="18px" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="18px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M9.09 9a3 3 0 0 1 5.83 1c0 2-3 3-3 3"></path><line x1="12" x2="12.01" y1="17" y2="17"></line></svg>
- The function name that is the entry point to your algorithm.

You can find your algorithms, alongside others, to be readily consumed as [Statistics as a Service](https://cannlytics.com/stats).
